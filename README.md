# Jimbob's Rusty Nickel!

## Setting up Cargo
Cargo is a popular package manager for Rust projects.

Check if you have it installed with this command:
```
cargo --version
```

Then, just runnit:
```
cargo run
```

## Scaffolding

This project was scaffolded with:
```
cargo new jimbobs-rusty-nickel --bin
```

and a few modifications from this guide: https://nickel-org.github.io/getting-started.html

## Motivation
You may want to ask me, "Why, Jim? Why another new framework with this weird, obscure language, Rust"? Welp, it all started with me looking at this benchmarks table of different languages and frameworks: https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks. At the very top of list was this framework, Nickel, with a reported average response time from the benchmark tests of 0.1 milliseconds!! I thought to myself, "wow, zero-point-one milliseconds? Sounds too good to be true, if it's really a thing then I've got to get me some of that!" because I like to have really fast backend apis- the faster the better I'd say! So, if this lil' nickel project is supposedly the fastest of fast... why not give it a spin? ðŸ˜‰
